        <p> Let \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) be two fields in the two arms of the Michelson interferometers, the intensity at the detector plane is given by \(I=\langle E_1E_2^*(t+\tau)\rangle\), where \(\langle . \rangle \) represents 
            the average over a long time \(T\) much larger than the response time of the detector and \(\tau\) is the time delay between the two fields. Consider than one arm is longer than the other
            by an amount \(\delta L\), then \(\tau=2\delta L/c\) if the two arms are filled by air. This time integration gives a final intensity as a function of \(\tau\) like,
            \[
            I(\tau)=I_0\bigg[1+|\gamma(\tau)|\cos\bigg(\frac{2\pi\delta\nu}{c}\bigg)\bigg]
        \]</p>
